<P><B>Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Telephone
Company Requirements (Part 68 of the FCC Rules)</B>
<OL>
<P><LI>The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 makes it unlawful
for any person to use a computer or other electronic device to send
any message via a telephone fax machine unless such message clearly
contains in a margin at the top or bottom of each transmitted page
or on the first page of the transmission, the date and time it is
sent and an identification of the business or other entity, or other
individual sending the message and the telephone number of the
sending machine or such business, other entity, or individual.
<P>In order to program this information into your computer, you should
be sure to follow the installation instructions for your fax software
package.
<P><LI>The built-in modem is built into the ThinkPad computer.  It
complies with Part 68 of the FCC Rules.  A label is affixed to the
bottom of the computer that contains, among other things, the FCC
registration number, USOC, and Ringer Equivalency Number (REN) for this
equipment.  If these numbers are requested, look at the label and
provide this information to your telephone company.
<P><LI>The REN is useful to determine the quantity of devices you
may connect to your telephone line and still have those devices ring
when your number is called.  In most, but not all, areas, the sum of the
RENs of all devices should not exceed five (5.0).  To be certain of
the number of devices you may connect to your line, as determined by
the REN, you should call your local telephone company to determine
the maximum REN for your calling area.
<P><LI>If the built-in modem causes harm to the telephone network,
the telephone company may discontinue your service temporarily.  If
possible, they will notify you in advance.  But, if advance notice
isn't practical, you will be notified as soon as possible.  You will
be advised of your right to file a complaint with the FCC.
<P><LI>Your telephone company may make changes in its facilities,
equipment, operations, or procedures that could affect the proper
operation of your equipment.  If they do, you will be given advance
notice so as to give you an opportunity to maintain uninterrupted
service.
<P><P>
<P><LI>If you experience trouble with this built-in modem, contact your
IBM Authorized Seller, or the IBM Corporation, 500 Columbus
Avenue, Thornwood, NY 10594, 1-800-772-2227, for repair/warranty
information.  The telephone company may ask you to disconnect this
equipment from the network until the problem has been corrected,
or until you are sure the equipment is not malfunctioning.
<P><LI>No customer repairs are possible to the modem.  If you experience
trouble with this equipment, contact your Authorized Seller or
the IBM Corporation for information.
<P><LI>The modem may not be used on coin service provided by the
telephone company.  Connection to party lines is subject to state
tariffs.  Contact your state public utility commission or corporation
commission for information.
<P><LI>When ordering network interface (NI) service from the Local
Exchange Carrier, specify service arrangement USOC RJ11C.
