Digital Video Producer (DVP) is an application program that
has the following functions&#58;
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Capturing, compressing, and building a video file
<LI>Capturing a still image (see <A HREF="#SPTCAPTURE">reference #43</A>)
</UL>
<P><B><I>Capturing, Compressing, and Building a Video File</I></B>
<P>This sample procedure describes how to capture a video clip,
import it to DVP, and build a compressed .AVI file that
you can use in a presentation and other computer-based
materials.  The video file created in this example
has the following characteristics.
(You need approximately 17MB of hard disk
space to capture a video file.)

Make sure your video source (such as a VCR or video camera)
is correctly connected to your computer before you start
the video capture.  If you select overlay mode from the
Options menu in DVP Capture, you can verify the
connection and look at your video both
before and during the capture.

<P>To capture, compress, and build a video file&#58;
<OL>
<P><LI>Start DVP; then select <B>Video Capture</B>
from the Tools menu.
<P><LI>Select <B>Set Capture File</B> from the File menu.
<P><LI><A NAME="LIS3">&nbsp;</A>Enter a name for your capture file (such as CAPTURE.AVI)
and specify the directory in which to save the file;
then click on <B>OK</B>.
<P><LI>Select <B>Allocate File Space</B> from the File menu and
enter 17MB as the hard disk space to set
aside for your capture file; then click on <B>OK</B>.
<P><LI>Select <B>Audio Format</B> from the Options menu.
<P><LI>Select these sound options&#58;
<B>8-bit</B>, <B>11kHz</B>, and <B>Mono</B>.
Then click on <B>OK</B>.
<P><LI>Select <B>Video Format</B> from the Options menu.
<P><LI>Select <B>160x120</B>
for Image Dimensions and
<B>Overlay YUV422</B> or <B>Compressed YUV422</B> for
Image Format; then click on <B>OK</B>.
<P><LI>Select <B>Video Source</B> from the Options menu,
the type of video connector your video source uses
(video or S-video), and the type of video signal
(NTSC or PAL).
<P>To see the supported color standard list of countries,
see the ThinkPad Features program help.
<P><LI>Select <B>Settings</B> from the Capture menu
and specify the following options&#58;
<DL>
<P><DT><B>Frame Rate
</B><DD>15 frames per second
<P><DT><B>Enable Capture Time Limit
</B><DD>30 seconds
<P><DT><B>Capture Storage
</B><DD>Capture to Disk
<P><DT><B>End Capture Using
</B><DD>Escape Key
</DL>
<P><LI>Check <B>Capture Audio</B>; then click on <B>OK</B>.
<P><LI>To start the video capture, select <B>Video</B> from the
Capture menu.
<P>DVP Capture saves the file with the name you specified
in step <A HREF="#LIS3">3</A>.  You can then save the file to a new name by
choosing <B>Save Captured File As</B> from the File menu.
<P><LI>Select <B>Exit</B> from the File menu to close
DVP Capture and return to DVP.
<P>DVP automatically imports the video file you just
captured and displays it in the Media window.
<P><LI>Drag your video clip from the Media window onto
the tick bar (directly above the video A track on the timeline).
<P>Dragging a clip onto the tick bar is an efficient
way to lay out your clip because the video and audio
information in the file appears automatically on both
the video A and audio A tracks. You can also lay out a
video clip on the timeline by dragging it
first from the Media window to a video track, and then
from the Media window to an audio track.
<P><LI>Select <B>Compression</B> from the Video menu
to specify the compression/decompression (CODEC)
routine you want to use.
<P><LI>Select <B>Intel(**) Indeo(**) Video R3.2</B>
for Compressor and accept the default
values for Key Frame Every and Data Rate; then click on <B>OK</B>.
<P><LI>Select <B>Build</B> from the Video menu.
Enter the name and location
of your final .AVI file (making sure to keep
the .AVI extension); then click on <B>Build</B>.
<P>The Build Progress dialog box opens, so you can
look at the percentage-complete bar and the preview
window to track the progress of the build.
Building a video can take anywhere from a few
minutes to several hours, depending on its length and complexity,
and on the type of compressor you select.
