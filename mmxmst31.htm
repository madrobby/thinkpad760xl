<P>Computer problems can be caused by software, hardware,
or both.
You can diagnose and solve
many problems with the assistance of the
self-tests and system programs contained in <I>Easy-Setup</I>.
If a hardware problem is detected by the self-tests,
an error message is displayed.
<P>The system programs can identify a
problem or provide information for the service representative.
Make a note of all error codes and give them to the
service representative when you call for service.
If the system programs cannot be loaded, the troubleshooting charts
and other information will help you determine what
corrective action to take.
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH=100%><TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>Important</TH><TR><TD>
<P>Use this chapter to test only <I>IBM</I> products.
Non-IBM products can cause misleading error information or incorrect
computer responses.  When testing non-IBM products,
